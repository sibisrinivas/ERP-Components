                    In today’s rapidly changing business environment, ever-greater demands are being 
                    placed on business on every industry, such as to provide products and services 
                    quicker, with greater added value, to the correct location, with no relevant 
                    inventory position, etc. However, customers are more sophisticated by wanting 
                    more quality, design, innovation, choice, convenience and service, and they want 
                    to spend less money, effort, time and risk. Hence, every business has to deal 
                    with highly competitive situation in order to survive; Supply Chain Management 
                    (SCM) becoming the main topic for improving efficiency and satisfy customer’s 
                    need.<br />
                    <br />
                    The supply chain of a company consists of different departments, ranging from 
                    procurement of materials to customer service. Supply chain management means 
                    transforming a company’s “supply chain” into an optimally efficient, 
                    customer-satisfying process, where the effectively of the whole supply chain is 
                    more important than the effectiveness of each individual department. Cost 
                    involved in the Supply Chain operation and process can be significant 
                    influencing the satisfaction of customers and the whole chain efficiency. The 
                    following assignment I will be focus on the total cost concept in operating 
                    supply chains of my selected firm.<br />
                    <br />
                    Every business organization needs to delivers products to its customers. 
                    Traditionally we would have described these products as either goods or 
                    services. Then manufacturers like Sony makes electronic products or Toyota makes 
                    cars these kinds of tangible goods, while the Vodafone makes mobile or Internet 
                    service provide the intangible services. In reality, this view is rather 
                    uncertainly, some products are really a complex package that contains both goods 
                    and services. The organization that I have chosen is one of the largest computer 
                    manufacture and IT consulting company that contains both goods and services. The 
                    IBM Company.</p>
